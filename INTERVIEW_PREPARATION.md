## ðŸ›  **Technical Questions**

### Q6: What is your experience with the MERN stack?
**Answer:**
"I have hands-on experience with all MERN components:

- **MongoDB:** Database design, schema creation, aggregation pipelines, and data modeling
- **Express.js:** RESTful API development, middleware implementation, error handling, and authentication

I've used this stack in my LearnHub project for building a complete learning management system with user authentication, course management, and progress tracking."

### Q7: How do you handle state management in React?
**Answer:**
"I use different state management approaches based on project complexity:

- **Local State:** useState and useReducer for component-level state
- **Context API:** For sharing state across multiple components without prop drilling
- **Custom Hooks:** For reusable stateful logic
- **Local Storage:** For data persistence in client-side applications like EasySplit

In my projects, I prioritize keeping state as close to where it's used as possible, and only lift state up when multiple components need access to it."

### Q8: Explain your approach to responsive design.
**Answer:**
"I follow a mobile-first approach:

1. **Design Process:** Start with mobile layout, then scale up
2. **CSS Techniques:** Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout, media queries for breakpoints
3. **Framework Integration:** In React projects, I use styled-components for dynamic styling
4. **Testing:** Test across different devices and browsers
5. **Performance:** Optimize images and assets for different screen sizes

All my projects (EliteShop, EasySplit, Shophub) are fully responsive and provide excellent user experience across devices."

### Q9: How do you ensure your applications are performant?
**Answer:**
"Performance optimization is crucial in my development process:

- **Code Splitting:** Lazy loading components in React applications
- **Image Optimization:** Proper image formats and sizes
- **Caching:** Implementing service workers in PWAs like EliteShop
- **Bundle Optimization:** Using tools like Webpack for efficient bundling
- **Database Queries:** Optimizing MongoDB queries and indexing
- **CDN Usage:** Deploying on platforms like Vercel for global distribution

I regularly use browser dev tools to monitor performance metrics and identify bottlenecks."

## ðŸ”§ **Problem-Solving Questions**

### Q10: Describe a challenging bug you encountered and how you solved it.
**Answer:**
"In EliteShop, I encountered an issue where the PWA wasn't properly caching resources, causing poor offline performance.

**Problem:** Service worker wasn't updating cached files when new versions were deployed
**Investigation:** Used browser dev tools to analyze network requests and service worker lifecycle
**Solution:** 
- Implemented proper cache versioning strategy
- Added cache invalidation logic for updates
- Used workbox for more reliable service worker management
**Result:** Improved offline functionality and user experience

This taught me the importance of thorough testing for PWA features and understanding browser caching mechanisms."

### Q11: How do you approach debugging in your applications?
**Answer:**
"I follow a systematic debugging approach:

1. **Reproduce the Issue:** Understand the exact steps that cause the problem
2. **Use Dev Tools:** Browser console, React DevTools, network tab for investigation
3. **Logging:** Strategic console.log statements and error handling
4. **Isolation:** Break down the problem into smaller parts
5. **Documentation:** Keep track of solutions for future reference

I also implement proper error boundaries in React applications and comprehensive error handling in backend APIs."

## ðŸ’¡ **Technical Depth Questions**

### Q12: Explain the difference between client-side and server-side rendering.
**Answer:**
"**Client-Side Rendering (CSR):**
- JavaScript runs in the browser to generate content
- Faster subsequent page loads, better user interactions
- Used in my React projects like EliteShop and EasySplit
- Challenges: SEO, initial load time

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**
- HTML is generated on the server before sending to browser
- Better SEO, faster initial page load
- More server resources required

**When to use:** CSR for interactive applications, SSR for content-heavy sites needing SEO optimization."

### Q13: How do you handle API integration in your projects?
**Answer:**
"I follow RESTful API best practices:

- **Frontend:** Use fetch API or axios for HTTP requests
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive try-catch blocks and user-friendly error messages
- **Loading States:** Show appropriate loading indicators during API calls
- **Data Validation:** Validate both request and response data
- **Authentication:** Handle JWT tokens securely
- **Caching:** Implement appropriate caching strategies

In my projects, I create dedicated service modules for API calls to maintain clean separation of concerns."
