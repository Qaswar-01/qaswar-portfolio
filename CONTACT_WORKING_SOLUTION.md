# Contact Form - Working Solution

## âœ… Current Implementation (Works Immediately)

The contact form now uses a **mailto approach** that will always work:

1. **User fills out the form**
2. **Clicks "Send Message"**
3. **Their default email client opens** with a pre-filled message
4. **User clicks send** in their email client

### Benefits:
- âœ… **Works immediately** - no setup required
- âœ… **Always reliable** - uses system email client
- âœ… **Professional appearance** - form looks and feels complete
- âœ… **User-friendly** - clear feedback and instructions
